# Innoviz API <!-- omit in toc -->

The Innoviz API is the application program interface used for (a) communicating with the software running on an InnovizOne™ LiDAR sensor system and (b) for viewing the point cloud that the LiDAR produces. Point clouds are saved in Innoviz’s proprietary .invz file format.  

The LiDAR uses TCP and UDP to transmit the point cloud and allow configuration: UDP is used to send the point cloud data continuously as a broadcast and TCP is used for command and control. All TCP and UDP parameters, including network settings, are configured in the Innoviz Web Server (under development) or sent to the unit via TCP. The LiDAR supports IPv4. 

The API is used by third-party visualization utilities to enable them to view Innoviz point clouds.

# Supported Operating Systems
- Windows 10 
    - Requires [Npcap installation](https://nmap.org/npcap/) 
- Ubuntu 18.04


# C++
API documentation can be found at [docs/html/index.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/InnovizTechnologies/InnovizAPI/blob/main/docs/c%2B%2B/html/index.html).
To use the API, add the path of the [include](include) folder to the compiler's "Include Directories" list, and link against the appropriate innovizApi library in the [lib](lib) folder.

## Building the example - Windows
Go to the [examples/cpp](examples/cpp) folder and run:
```
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -B "build"
```
This will create a Visual Studio solution in the "build" directory.
Open the solution and you will be able to build and run the various examples.

## Building the example - Linux
Go to the [examples/cpp](examples/cpp) folder and run:
```
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -B "build"
cd build
make all
```
This will build all of the examples.
These projects can be built by running the "make" command from their location.

## Running the example - Windows
The example needs to be able to find the innovizApi library in order to run.
For Windows this means adding the path of the library you wish to use to the PATH environment variable.
<br>
Once this is done, and the application is build, you should be able to run the various example applications from the Visual Studio solution. 

## Running the example - Linux
The example needs to be able to find the innovizApi library in order to run.
For Linux you must add the path to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
<br>
Once this is done, and the application is build, you should be able to run the various example applications. Run them from the "build" folder created [earlier](#building-the-example---linux).
<br>
Additionally, the API requires enhanced networking permissions to run, so the application must be run as sudo or specific priviliges need to be granted with setcap.
<br>
For Example:
```
sudo ./OM_Recording_Example/om_recording_example
```
Or:
```
sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip ./OM_Recording_Example/om_recording_example
./OM_Recording_Example/om_recording_example
```

# Python
## Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.6.
- pybind11 python module.
- numpy python module.

<br>
On windows machines a the Visual Studio Build Tools are required.
This can be downloaded and installed from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/.

## Installation
To install the module run the following command:
```
python -m pip install {path_to_module}
```
Where *{Path_to_module}* is the path to the ['python' directory](python).

<br>
To uninstall the python module run the following command:
```
python -m pip uninstall innopy
```
On linux distributions use 'python3' instead of 'python' in the commands above.

## Examples
Various examples that use the python interface can be found under [examples/python](examples/python).
The python interface requires enhanced networking permissions to run, so the python scripts must be run as sudo or specific priviliges need to be granted to python using setcap as shown [above](#running-the-example---linux).

# ROS
